###############################################
The main R code is divided into sections:

1, data loading section
This section requires external data from the BioGRID website, which can be accessed by https://thebiogrid.org/
The parser attached in the Github is also required

2, Network summary metrics
This section considers applying global and local network summary metrics to the PPI networks
The outputs are mainly used in the data quality and network description section of the dissertation

3, Network Comparison
This section requires sourcing the GCD and GDDA code attached in this Github project
The outputs are mainly used in the network comparison section of the dissertation

4, Pholygenetic tree comparison
This section requires the input of the NCBI pholygenetic tree data, which can be accessed by https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/treeviewer/

5, Significance testing
This section considers the two statistical testing used in the dissertation

6, Essential protein initial analysis
This section requires the essential protein data from DEG, which can be accessed by http://origin.tubic.org/deg/public/index.php

7, Essential protein logistic regression
This section considers the two setups of logistic regression to predict essential proteins of the PPI networks
